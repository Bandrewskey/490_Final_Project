negatives. And we approached this by adding a function that would address the disparity metrics within our data set. Within our data set a false positive is when for one data point score = 1 and label value = 0. A false negative is when score = 0 and label value = 1. So, what a group adjusted false positive means is that, in some instances groups of individuals may be included in some category or population they don’t belong in. Thus, the term false positive. So, if I had a group of individuals that were on trial, the question becomes what the chances are they would be wrongly convicted because they were a part of a specific category or population. And our feature that we added wanted to address and highlight this disparity. \n","\n","  On the contrary a group adjusted false negative works in the opposite fashion. So, given a group of individuals on trial, an individual would be found innocent even though they were guilty. And again, our feature addresses this by highlighting the disparity within the data set. As you can see in the example above, the rates at which group adjusted false positives and negatives occur (among each group) are listed above. (Code as well as example is listed above)"]}]}
